# Assignment-3-CISC-3130
My code first reads in the file, then splits up the movie title and date into two separate child nodes (left and right)
The left node contains the movie title, and the right contains the date of the movie
In my main class, I prompt the user to search up the movie list I have after entering their desired movie to show up
The list is pulled up based on the movie they enter.
In my MovieBST class, I also sort the elements alphabetically.
The sample output would be:
"Enter movie names to search"
Then it would print the list after passing the values to Movie.
It repeats until the user enters "q", a placeholder I have for a quit option.
